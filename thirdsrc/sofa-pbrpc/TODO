Http support
------------
Support http protocol, then user can call methods through http, e.g., by browser.
Request and response message may be serialized/deserialized in json format. 
This will provide better usability.


Multi-server load balance (done)
-------------------------
By providing multi-server addresses (statically or dynamically), one client stub
can access services deployed on different servers, with intelligent load balance.

Cross-language client
---------------------
Provide rpc client lib in other languages, e.g., java and python.
